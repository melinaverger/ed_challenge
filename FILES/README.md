Mélina Verger -- August 2021

The goal of this challenge is to predict students’ performance from a collection of students’ information and interactions during a 1-hour online course that is on the topic of the brain and intended for a general audience. 

IMPORTANT:
At this time, we lack samples and could only offer a toy challenge. Nonetheless, this project could easily be continued and extended (please see the summary report in the project repository in references).

The dataset is composed by 15 features. The training, validation and test sets contains 19, 4 and 5 samples respectively. 10 training samples are available to challenge participants to experiment their models. We encourage you to consult the project repository (see references) and in particular the related report in the documentation folder to find more details on the features and on how the dataset was built. 

You will have to perform a binary classification where the two classes, pass (1) or fail (0) refer to whether a student has had the average course grade or more.
